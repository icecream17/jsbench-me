# jsbench.me - JavaScript performance benchmarking playground

This is a public wiki & issue tracker for [jsbench.me](https://jsbench.me) project.

Jsbench.me is performance benchmarking playground for JavaScript, heavily inspired and influenced by jsperf.com and jsfiddle.net. It uses Benchmarkjs.com to execute test suites.

Now you can execute and compare  execution speed of different JavaScript code snippets, but also share it and collaborate with others online through simple and short URL.

**Features:**

* Free to use
* Create multiple tests in test case.
* "Setup JavaScript" and "teardown JavaScript" to execute before and after each test run.
* "Setup HTML" to test DOM manipulation.
* Include external libraries through simple `<SCRIPT>` tag in "Setup HTML"
* Test run in sanboxed Iframe to increase security
* Test suite versioning
* Fork test sutes
* List user's publis test suites
* Fast and efficient UI built as single page app (Reactjs/Mobx)
* Reliable and scalable infrastructure, mostly Amazon AWS (Cognito user pool, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB)

**Important:**
jsbench.me is currently in beta stage, tested only on latest browsers. We're working daily on polishing, testing on different browsers and debugging. Your comments and issue reports are very welcomed in this stage!
As soon as we reach stable version with basic functionality, we have very long list of more advanced  features to implement. Depending on your input, this list will change during beta. So, please check our Wiki and Issues section.
